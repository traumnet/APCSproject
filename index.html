   <div class= "dropdown2"> <h2> about </h2> 
      <div class= "dropdown_content2"> 
         <p> This is a student project aiming to educate high school students         
          about mental health and end stigma around various mental illnesses. </p> <p> <h3> Stigma? What do you mean? </h3>  
          Well, mental illnesses aren't a topic people like talk about or support advocacy for. Meaning, it's not as common to receive 
          education about mental health so much as an illness like cancer. Because it tends to be a taboo topic, there are many 
          misconceptions and inaccurate stereotypes that get spread around without anyone challenging them. These stereotypes tend to permeate
          media. Movies like "Split"? Villains that are "psychos"? Common characterizations like those are typically based off of wildly 
          exaggerated,misguided stereotypes about mental illnesses. Unfortunately for the people who <i> have </i>
          the illnesses that media typically misrepresents, that only perpetuates harmful stereotypes and ideas about them. <p> 
          The fact that mental illness is a social taboo 
          can also result in someone not being able to reach out for help for fear of judgement by peers or family.
          In other cases, it means not recognizing symptoms in yourself or your friends. People who have received diagnoses
          and are receiving treatment for mental health issues are affected by this as well. The harmful stereotypes surrounding 
          certain illnesses,
          or even specific symptoms, ostracizes people who experience them from their peers and even families. 
          The goal of this site is to deconstruct these stereotypes and provide a more supportive, informative way of looking at what 
          is a more common issue than people might realize.</p>

   <div class="dropdown3"> <h2> statistics </h2> 
   <div class="dropdown_content3">
       <h3> stats; </h3> 
       <p> <ul> 
         <li> 1 in 5 adults in the U.S. experience some form of mental illness. Given everyone in the U.S. over 18 according to the 2004
         census, this is about 58 million people.</li> 
         <li> 18.1% of adults in the U.S. experience anxiety disorders such as PTSD (post traumatic stress disorder), 
         OCD (obsessive-compulsive disorder), and specific phobias that impair daily functioning.</li>
         <li> Over a third of students aged 14-21 with a mental illness end up dropping out. This is the highest rate
         of any disability demograph.</li>
         <li> Approximately 1.1% of the U.S. population is affected by schizophrenia disorder. </li>
         <li> 2.6% of adults in the U.S. have bipolar disorder. </li>
         <li> People with serious mental illnesses are more prone to chronic medical conditions. </li> 
         <li> Suicide is the tenth leading cause of death in the U.S. </li>
         <li> About 44,000 Americans die by suicide each year. </li>
         <li> Men are four times more likely to die by suicide than women, however, women statistcally attempt suicide 3 times as often
         as men.</li>
      </ul>  
     </div>
     </div>  
  
  <div class="dropdown4"> <h2> mood disorders </h2>
    <div class="dropdown_content4"> 
      <h3> depression; </h3> <p> Depression affects more than 20 million people in the U.S. It is a disorder that is characterized by 
      persistent feelings of sadness, isolation, and difficulty mustering motivation to go through with daily tasks. Causes can range 
      anywhere from genetics,environment, trauma or experiences of abuse, or psychological/biochemical reasons, such as being
      unable to produce healthy levels of dopamine. Note that depression doesn't look the same in every person that has it, and that
      people who "don't look depressed" or don't act in a way that would commonly be characterized as "depressed" can't be affected by
      it. It is common for anyone who has a mental illness to attempt to hide it for a variety of reasons. Depression is no exception.
      Symptoms include:
      <ul>
        <li>restlessness and irritability </li>
        <li>insomnia or frequent oversleeping </li>
        <li>suicideal ideation; thoughts of death </li>
        <li>persistent feelings of worthlessness, guilt, hopelessness, and general pessimism </li>
        <li>drastic changes in weight </li>
        <li>changes in diet and eating habits (periods of eating too much or too little, that are not features of a comorbid eating 
          disorder) </li>
        <li>difficulty concentrating, remembering things, and making decisions </li>
      
      </ul>
      <p> People with depression may find it hard to succeed academically, maintain healthy relationships, or keep a job. They may go 
        unaware of their condition or be reluctant to reach out for help. Because depression can lead to suicide, it's important to be able
        to recognize symptoms in yourself or others, and be able to respond in such a way that doesn't cause someone's feelings of guilt
        or even self hate to spike in such a way that results in a crisis situation. Offering support to a depressed loved one needs to 
        be delicate - avoid making them feel guilty or burdensome, as it may result in them isolating themselves in such a way that results
        in them resorting to self destructive behaviors to cope. People who have suffered from depression unbeknownst to their family or 
        friends are susceptible to falling into self destructive cycles as a method of coping with their feelings, and it is important
        to their recovery that they do not feel they are being a burden by reaching out for help, or made to feel ashamed of their symptoms.
      <h3> bipolar disorder; </h3>
      <p> This disorder is characterized by intense, drastic changes in mood, from bouts of mania (feeling unusually happy
        and energetic without cause) to bouts of depression. While everyone experiences mood swings, the symptoms of bipolar disorder
        are intense enough to impair functioning and one's ability to think clearly between their "ups" and "downs". Episodes that occur
        with these mood swings impact the affected person's sleep schedule, level of activity, increase irritability, increase risky
        behavior, or, the exact opposite - a "down" episode may feature marked inactivity, thoughts of suicide, trouble with concentration
        poor memory, and feelings of worry or emptiness. These can last a week or multiple. </p> <br> <p> People who experience intense swings may also
        experience psychosis as a feature of the illness. This doesn't make them dangerous, or untreatable. There are medications 
        specifically designed to even out mood swings, just like a physical illness typically has medications for its symptoms. People with
        bipolar disorder can also use various kinds of therapy (CBT, REBT, etc) to help them, especially where maintaining their close 
        relationships is involved. While executive functioning and ability to keep close relationships may be affected by bipolar disorder, 
        proper treatment and medication (as with any illness) will help an individual manage control of those aspects of their life.
        
        
        
      <h3> seasonal affective disorder; </h3>
          <p> Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) is a form of depression that occurs during a single season or period of the year, usually
            starting in the winter and gradually decreasing in the spring. Common treatments include medication and therapy, just as with 
            depression. Symptoms are also very similar:
            <ul>
              <li>abnormal changes in weight </li>
              <li>oversleeping or not sleeping enough</li>
              <li>feelings of hopelessness, pessimism, worthlessness. </li>
              <li>a loss of interest or pleasure in what one would normally enjoy </li>
              <li>fatigue and low energy</li>
              <li>thoughts of suicide and death</li>
           </ul> 
                
    </div> 
  </div> 
  
  <div class="dropdown5"> <h2> anxiety disorders </h2>
    <div class="dropdown_content5">
      <h3> generalized anxiety disorder: </h3> <p> General anxiety, while not always obvious from a third party's perspective, can severely
      inhibit the daily functioning (like most mental illnesses) of someone who has it. This includes work, school, maintaining
      interpersonal relationships, and rountinal tasks. Symptoms include:
      <ul>
        <li> restlessness/ feeling "on edge" </li>
        <li> difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep </li>
        <li> difficulty concentrating </li>
        <li> panic attacks: this can entail an increased heart rate, feelings of intense fear or sense of danger, sense of dizziness and 
          chest pain, confusion, derealization (feelings of unreality) or depersonalization (being detached from oneself), sweating, 
          nausea. Note that the way a panic attack manifests will vary from person to person. It doesn't always look like someone "breaking
          down crying" and can even go unnoticed to onlookers.
       </ul>

  <div class="dropdown6"> <h2> psychotic disorders </h2>
    <div class="dropdown_content6"> <p> <h3> Whoa whoa, doesn't that mean people who are psychopaths and need to be locked up? </h3>
      No, not at all. The idea of a "violent psycho", "schizo", and related tropes/stereotypes are entirely made up and media perpetuated 
      for the sake of shock value. People with psychotic disorders are <b>not</b> inherently dangerous. In fact, violent behavior towards 
      others isn't even a diagnostic criterion for <i> any </i> psychotic disorder. Using words like "psycho", "schizo", "crazy", and so on,
      to describe someone whose behaviors are regarded as violent or threatening only deepens the divide between fact and misconception where
      these types of disorders are concerned.
      <h3> psychosis criteria: </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>delusions: beliefs/ideas that are untrue, and not based in reality or logical thinking. </li>
          <li> hallucinations, auditory or visual. </li>
          <li>disorganized thinking/speech: when verbal responses are unrelated, obliquely related, or nonsensical to
          the context of a conversation; switching from one topic another sporadically; note that disorganized speech can be common
          and it must be severe enough in an individual as to impair verbal communication to be considered a diagnostic criterion.</li>
          <li>grossly disorganized or abnormal motor behavior: catatonia (lack of reaction to environmental stimuli),
           bizarre posture, echoed speech, etc.</li>
          <li>negative symptoms: diminished emotional expression (monotonous speech, reduced eye contact, minimal facial expression); 
            antisocial tendencies; </li>
        </ul>
      
       <p>  Schizophrenia is perhaps the most well known psychotic disorder. People affected bit may experience hallucinations in which they 
        see or hear things that are not in fact there, perceive danger or harm that aren't real, have poor executive functioning, and 
        trouble with working memory. Stigma around psychosis, and schizophrenia specifically, can make a person reluctant to reach out 
        for help or voice what they are experiencing. Contrary to popular belief, those affected by schizophrenia are not violent, and
         are more likely to exhibit harmful behaviors towards themselves than others. </p> <br> <p> Schizophrenia is also correlated with substance
        abuse, as well as suicidal ideation and attempts. While about 1 percent of the population is affected by the disorder, a family
        history of psychosis/psychotic disorders increases one's risk for having/developing the disorder. In addition, there are also
        definite environmental factors, meaning, genetics alone does not determine one's disposition to the disorder. Treatment of
        schizophrenia typically entails a combination of antipsychotic medication and some form of individual therapy, such as cognitive
        behavioral therapy (CBT).
