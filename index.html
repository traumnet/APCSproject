      <div class= "dropdown_content2"> 
         <p> This is a student project aiming to educate high school students         
          about mental health and end stigma around various mental illnesses. </p> <p> <h3> Stigma? What do you mean? </h3>  
          Well, mental illnesses aren't a topic people like talk about or support advocacy for. Meaning, it's not as common to receive 
          education about mental health so much as an illness like cancer. Because it tends to be a taboo topic, there are many 
          misconceptions and inaccurate stereotypes that get spread around without anyone challenging them. These stereotypes tend to permeate
          media. Movies like "Split"? Villains that are "psychos"? Common characterizations like those are typically based off of wildly 
          exaggerated,misguided stereotypes about mental illnesses. Unfortunately for the people who <i> have </i>
          the illnesses that media typically misrepresents, that only perpetuates harmful stereotypes and ideas about them. <p> 
          The fact that mental illness is a social taboo 
          can also result in someone not being able to reach out for help for fear of judgement by peers or family.
          In other cases, it means not recognizing symptoms in yourself or your friends. People who have received diagnoses
          and are receiving treatment for mental health issues are affected by this as well. The harmful stereotypes surrounding 
          certain illnesses,
          or even specific symptoms, ostracizes people who experience them from their peers and even families. 
          The goal of this site is to deconstruct these stereotypes and provide a more supportive, informative way of looking at what 
          is a more common issue than people might realize.</p>

       <h3> stats; </h3> 
       <p> <ul> 
         <li> 1 in 5 adults in the U.S. experience some form of mental illness. Given everyone in the U.S. over 18 according to the 2004
         census, this is about 58 million people.</li> 
         <li> 18.1% of adults in the U.S. experience anxiety disorders such as PTSD (post traumatic stress disorder), 
         OCD (obsessive-compulsive disorder), and specific phobias that impair daily functioning.</li>
         <li> Over a third of students aged 14-21 with a mental illness end up dropping out. This is the highest rate
         of any disability demograph.</li>
         <li> Approximately 1.1% of the U.S. population is affected by schizophrenia disorder. </li>
         <li> 2.6% of adults in the U.S. have bipolar disorder. </li>
         <li> People with serious mental illnesses are more prone to chronic medical conditions. </li> 
         <li> Suicide is the tenth leading cause of death in the U.S. </li>
         <li> About 44,000 Americans die by suicide each year. </li>
         <li> Men are four times more likely to die by suicide than women, however, women statistcally attempt suicide 3 times as often
         as men.</li>

      <h3> generalized anxiety disorder; </h3> <p> General anxiety, while not always obvious from a third party's perspective, can severely
      inhibit the daily functioning (like most mental illnesses) of someone who has it. This includes work, school, maintaining
      interpersonal relationships, and rountinal tasks. Symptoms include:
      <ul>
        <li> restlessness/ feeling "on edge" </li>
        <li> difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep </li>
        <li> difficulty concentrating </li>
        <li> panic attacks: this can entail an increased heart rate, feelings of intense fear or sense of danger, sense of dizziness and 
          chest pain, confusion, derealization (feelings of unreality) or depersonalization (being detached from oneself), sweating, 
          nausea. Note that the way a panic attack manifests will vary from person to person. It doesn't always look like someone "breaking
          down crying" and can even go unnoticed to onlookers.
